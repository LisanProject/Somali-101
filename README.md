# Somali-101

# Somali Summer Intensive

A community-driven curriculum for teaching Somali to heritage learners of all ages. Designed for rapid fluency in a few months, this project includes vocabulary lists, grammar lessons, cultural activities, and intergenerational engagement strategies. The initial plan is to have a trial run for weekend and summer programs run by community members.
