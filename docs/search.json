    "text": "© 2025 Liban Hussein\nSomali 101 is a grassroots language learning initiative designed to help learners of all ages reconnect with the Somali language in a structured, supportive, and culturally rooted way.\nWhether you’re a heritage speaker looking to regain fluency, a complete beginner, or part of the older generation hoping to pass on your knowledge, this project is for you.\nThe curriculum emphasizes real-world communication, intergenerational learning, and accessible resources. All materials are offered openly to empower communities to teach and learn together.\n\n\n\n\n\n📚 Vocabulary Lists organized by theme and chapter\n\n🗣️ Dialogues and Conversation Practice rooted in everyday situations\n\n🧠 Grammar Explanations with simple examples\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Activities for All Ages, including ways for elders to share knowledge\n\n🌍 Cultural Notes and Somali Proverbs to deepen language learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuhimmadda Luuqadda Af Soomaaliga – Why Speaking the Somali Language Matters\n\n\n\nThis disconnection from their mother tongue often leads to a deeper estrangement from their heritage, stories, and identity — leaving cultural wisdom unspoken, and generational bonds weakened. Reclaiming the Somali language is not just about communication; it is an act of restoration, belonging, and pride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA True Story\n\n\n\nAnoo yar dugsi qur’aanka dhiganaayo halkaan (Maraykanka), waxaan xasuustaa wiil iila dhigan jiray oo qosol iyo kaftan badnaa Ibraahim la yiraahdo. Casharkiisa markuu ka baxay, waa loo fasaxay inuu gurigiisa tago.\nHooyadiisa markeey timid dugsigii, wiilkii wuxuu yiri,\n“𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧, 𝐦𝐚 𝐛𝐚𝐱𝐢 𝐤𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐚? 𝐇𝐨𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐞𝐲 𝐝𝐢𝐛𝐚𝐝𝐚 𝐮 𝐭𝐚𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐚.”\nMarkaan maqlay, waan yaabay, waayo, qofna kama saxin af soomaaligiisa qaldanaa. Waxa laga rabay inuu dheho,\n“Macalin, ma baxi karaa? Hooyadeey banaankeey joogtaa, ama banaankeey igu sugeeysaa.”\nMaalintaas waxaa igu soo dhacay, “amaad adiga laftigaaga ku hadashay af soomaali qaldan sidii saaxiibkaaga Ibraahim?”\nMaalintaas kaddib, waxaan asxaabteeyda iyo waalidkeeyga ka codsaday, haddii aad maqashiin anoo af soomaali qalad ah ku hadlaayo, igu qosol markii hore, kaddib na iga sax.\nSidaas daraadeed, waxaan helay buug laguu daabacay Xamar 1973-gii oo la yiraahdo “𝐀𝐚𝐬𝐚𝐚𝐤𝐬𝐚 𝐍𝐚𝐱𝐰𝐚𝐡𝐚 𝐀𝐟 𝐒𝐨𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐚”.\n\nGrowing up, I had a childhood friend named Ibrahim who I’d see during our weekend school (madrasa/dugsi). He was really bright and had a great sense of humor too.\nOne day, after he passed his lesson, he was given permission to go home. Long story short, when he finished his lesson and saw his mom parked outside, he asked for permission to leave (in Somali) but did so in an interesting way. Instead of saying “my mom is outside”, he said something along the lines of “my mom is located outside”, using a word more suited to inanimate objects.\nI was surprised that no one corrected what sounded like an obvious grammatical mistake. But I felt even worse realizing I too had made similar mistakes and had never been corrected.\nIn that moment, I began to wonder — was I also speaking Somali in a broken way, just like Ibrahim?\nFrom that day forward, I asked my friends and family to gently correct me whenever I spoke Somali incorrectly — even laugh a little if needed, then help me improve.\nShortly after, I discovered a grammar book published in Mogadishu in 1973 titled\n“The Foundations of Somali Grammar (Aasaaska Naxwaha Af Soomaaliga)”. Alhamdulillah I’ve been able to translate this work into English and hope this work benefits any English-speaking Somali who wants to understand the beauty and structure of our mother tongue."

    "text": "This document serves as a comprehensive guide for learners of the Somali language, designed to support both self-study and community-based instruction.\nIt is a central hub for:\n\nStructured study notes organized by theme\n\nEssential vocabulary relevant to everyday life\n\nPractice exercises for speaking, listening, reading, and writing\n\nCultural and generational engagement, including Somali proverbs and dialogues\n\nProgress tracking for students over the course of their learning\n\nThe course is intended for learners at all levels and is structured as a series of thematic units that build gradually toward fluency. It is especially suited for summer intensives or weekend community classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Somali Matters\n\n\n\nFor many Somali youth raised in the West, the inability to speak their mother tongue is a source of quiet grief — a feeling of being cut off from elders, stories, and the untranslatable richness of home.\nThis course is not just about grammar and vocabulary. It’s about reconnection.\nIt’s about helping a generation recover what was almost lost — and proudly carry it forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOral Heritage Lives Through Language\n\n\n\nSomali has been called a “nation of poets” — not because every Somali writes books, but because the oral transmission of wisdom, history, and values has traditionally been carried through language.\nLearning Somali is not just learning a language — it’s entering a cultural archive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage and Identity\n\n\n\n\nWhen a generation loses its tongue, it also loses its memory.\nPreserving Somali is preserving identity — not only for individuals, but for families, mosques, and communities seeking continuity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomali Proverb\n\n\n\n\nNin aan dhul marin, dhaayo ma leh.\nHe who has not traveled has no eyes.\n\nThis widely quoted proverb reminds learners that exposure expands understanding — just as travel opens the eyes, language opens doors to culture, connection, and insight.\n\n\n\n\nThe Somali alphabet uses Latin script with 21 consonants and 5 vowels. It was standardized in 1972 and is written left to right like English. Pronunciation is phonetic, meaning words are typically pronounced as they are spelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter\nExample\nPronunciation Guide\n\n\n\n\nʾ\nabuur\nGlottal stop — like a soft pause, similar to ء in Arabic\n\n\nB\nbuug\nLike b in “book”\n\n\nT\ntufaax\nLike t in “top”\n\n\nJ\njeer\nLike j in “job”\n\n\nKH\nkhamiis\nLike Arabic خ, a rough “kh” from the throat\n\n\nDH\ndhakhtar\nA voiced retroflex (tongue curled back), not found in English\n\n\nR\nroob\nRolled or tapped r, like in Spanish\n\n\nS\nsubax\nLike s in “sun”\n\n\nSH\nsheeko\nLike sh in “shoe”\n\n\nD\ndheer\nLike d in “door”\n\n\nC\ncunto\nA voiced pharyngeal sound (like ع in Arabic)\n\n\nG\nguri\nLike g in “go”\n\n\nF\nfuran\nLike f in “fun”\n\n\nQ\nqalin\nDeep k sound from the throat (like ق in Arabic)\n\n\nK\nkabo\nLike k in “kite”\n\n\nL\nlacag\nLike l in “light”\n\n\nM\nmeel\nLike m in “man”\n\n\nN\nnaag\nLike n in “name”\n\n\nW\nwebi\nLike w in “water”\n\n\nH\nhoy\nLike h in “hat”\n\n\nY\nyar\nLike y in “yes”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomali has 5 vowels: A, E, I, O, U, and each can be:\n\nShort (e.g., run – “true/truth”)\nLong (e.g., ruun – “home/settlement”)\n\nLong vowels are marked by doubling the letter (aa, ee, ii, oo, uu) and are pronounced longer and more forcefully. They can change the meaning of a word:\n\n\n\nShort\nLong\nMeaning (Short vs. Long)\n\n\n\n\nu\nuu\nbur = flour, buur = mountain\n\n\na\naa\ngal = enter, gaal = non-Muslim\n\n\ni\nii\nbir = metal, biir = increase/multiply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen and Repeat\n\n\n\nThe Somali language is best learned by listening. Repeating after a native speaker helps train your ear to subtle sounds like C, DH, and KH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nʾ (Glottal stop) represents a brief pause or a sound from the throat, like a soft catch in the breath — similar to Arabic ء (hamzah).\nC is not like the English “see” — it’s a voiced pharyngeal sound from the throat (like Arabic ع).\nDH is pronounced by curling the tongue back (retroflex). This sound does not exist in English.\nKH is like Arabic خ — a rough “kh” from the upper throat.\nQ is pronounced deep in the throat — not like “k”, but more forceful (like Arabic ق).\nR is lightly rolled, similar to Spanish.\nDouble vowels (aa, ee, etc.) are longer and often stressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip for Arabic Speakers\n\n\n\nIf you know Arabic, Somali letters C, Q, KH, and DH will sound familiar to you. But even native Arabic speakers need to adjust their ear for DH, which is distinct from Arabic sounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsbarasho wanaagsan waxay ku bilaabataa salaan iyo su’aalo aasaasi ah. Baabkani wuxuu soo bandhigayaa erayada muhiimka ah iyo weedho si aad u isticmaasho marka aad qof cusub la kulanto.\nA good introduction begins with greetings and basic questions. This chapter presents essential words and phrases for you to use when meeting someone new.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart With What You Know\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to memorize every word immediately.\nFocus on 5–7 phrases that you can say confidently — like your name, where you’re from, and how you’re doing. Then build from there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\nSomali\n\n\n\n\nPeace be upon you\nAsalaamu Calaykum\n\n\nAnd peace be upon you\nWa Calaykum Salaam\n\n\nGood morning\nSubax wanaagsan\n\n\nHow are you?\nSidee tahay / See tahay / Ii waran?\n\n\nI am fine\nWaan fiicanahay\n\n\nWelcome\nSoo dhowoow\n\n\nWhat is your name?\nMagacaa?\n\n\nMy name is …\nMagacaygu waa …\n\n\nWhere are you from?\nXagee baad ka timid?\n\n\nI am from Somalia\nWaxaan ka imid Soomaaliya\n\n\nNice to meet you\nKulan wanaagsan\n\n\nGoodbye\nNabadeey / Macsalaamo\n\n\nTeacher\nMacallin\n\n\nStudent\nArday\n\n\nPhone\nTelefoon\n\n\nAddress\nAdrees / Cinwaan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCultural Insight\n\n\n\nSomalis often greet with a warm tone and repeated blessings.
