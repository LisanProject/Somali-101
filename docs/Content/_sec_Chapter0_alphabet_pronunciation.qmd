## Shaqalka – Somali Vowels

Somali has **5 vowels**: **A, E, I, O, U**, and each can be:

- **Short** (e.g., *run* – "true/truth")
- **Long** (e.g., *ruun* – "home/settlement")

Long vowels are marked by doubling the letter (**aa, ee, ii, oo, uu**) and are pronounced **longer and more forcefully**. They can **change the meaning** of a word:

| Short | Long | Meaning (Short vs. Long)              |
|-------|------|----------------------------------------|
| u     | uu   | *bur* = flour, *buur* = mountain       |
| a     | aa   | *gal* = enter, *gaal* = non-Muslim     |
| i     | ii   | *bir* = metal, *biir* = increase/multiply           |

## Laxanka iyo Dhawaaqa – Notes on Pronunciation

- **ʾ (Glottal stop)** represents a **brief pause** or a sound from the throat, like a soft catch in the breath — similar to Arabic **ء** (hamzah).
- **C** is not like the English “see” — it’s a voiced **pharyngeal** sound from the throat (like Arabic **ع**).
- **DH** is pronounced by curling the tongue back (retroflex). This sound **does not exist in English**.
- **KH** is like Arabic **خ** — a rough “kh” from the upper throat.
- **Q** is pronounced **deep in the throat** — not like “k”, but more forceful (like Arabic **ق**).
- **R** is lightly rolled, similar to Spanish.
- **Double vowels (aa, ee, etc.)** are **longer** and often stressed.

::: {.callout-note title="Tip for Arabic Speakers"}
If you know Arabic, Somali letters **C, Q, KH, and DH** will sound familiar to you. But even native Arabic speakers need to adjust their ear for **DH**, which is distinct from Arabic sounds.
