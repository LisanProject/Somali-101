# Hordhac – Introduction {#sec-intro}

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for learners of the Somali language, designed to support both self-study and community-based instruction.

It is a central hub for:

- **Structured study notes** organized by theme  
- **Essential vocabulary** relevant to everyday life  
- **Practice exercises** for speaking, listening, reading, and writing  
- **Cultural and generational engagement**, including Somali proverbs and dialogues  
- **Progress tracking** for students over the course of their learning

The course is intended for learners at all levels and is structured as a series of thematic units that build gradually toward fluency. It is especially suited for summer intensives or weekend community classes.

::: {.callout-tip title="Why Somali Matters"}
For many Somali youth raised in the West, the inability to speak their mother tongue is a source of quiet grief — a feeling of being **cut off from elders, stories, and the untranslatable richness of home**.  

This course is not just about grammar and vocabulary. It’s about **reconnection**.  
It’s about helping a generation **recover what was almost lost** — and proudly carry it forward.

::: {.callout-note title="Oral Heritage Lives Through Language"}
Somali has been called a **"nation of poets"** — not because every Somali writes books, but because the oral transmission of wisdom, history, and values has traditionally been **carried through language**.  
Learning Somali is not just learning a language — it's entering a cultural archive.

::: {.callout-caution title="Language and Identity"}
> When a generation loses its tongue, it also loses its memory.  
Preserving Somali is preserving identity — not only for individuals, but for families, mosques, and communities seeking continuity.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Somali Proverb"}
> **Nin aan dhul marin, dhaayo ma leh.**  
> *He who has not traveled has no eyes.*

This widely quoted proverb reminds learners that **exposure expands understanding** — just as travel opens the eyes, **language opens doors** to culture, connection, and insight.
